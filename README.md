# me

This used to be my personal website, but now I'm using https://scott2000jones.github.io instead (see repository https://github.com/scott2000jones/scott2000jones.github.io)

This site now redirects there

The old site, built with Jekyll and the Academic Pages theme, is still here on the master branch
