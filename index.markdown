I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of St Andrews. I'm currently in my second year (having entered directly into second year).

I am proficient in Java, and I'm also familiar with JavaScript and Visual Basic. I'm currently interested in data science and big data, but have also done projects in artificial intelligence.

In my spare time I like to play and make music. I play the guitar and bass guitar, and also produce music electronically.
