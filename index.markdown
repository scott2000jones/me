I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of St Andrews. I'm in third year, having entered directly into second year, and working towards an integrated Master's degree (MSci).

Most of my work so far has been in Java and C, although I have also done significant work in Python, JavaScript, and Haskell. I have worked on multiple artificial intelligence projects as well, and I'm currently using Golang to attempt to train an LSTM nerual net on works of philosophy, so that it can share its wisdom on Twitter.

In my spare time I like to play and make music. I play the guitar and bass guitar, and also produce music electronically.
